FMUX(1)                                                                FMUX(1)



NAME
       fmux - combine files by alternating bytes

SYNOPSIS
       fmux [ -o outfile ] files...

DESCRIPTION
       Fmux  reads  consecutive  bytes  from  files and writes them to outfile
       (default standard output) by writing one byte  from  each  file  before
       moving to the next byte.  For instance,

              fmux a b

       writes  the  first byte of a, then the first byte of b, then the second
       byte of a, and so on.

       Fmux presently requires all files to have the same size; it  does  this
       by  checking  against  the  size of the first file given on the command
       line.

       Fmux returns 0 on success and nonzero on failure.

BUGS
       More constructive behavior if one file is shorter than the others could
       be done; the issue is that I do not know what the proper behavior is.

       For  the sake of low speed, fmux opens all files at once, reads them in
       one at a time, and copies them into a larger buffer.   This  uses  much
       memory; I have to try using smaller buffers.
